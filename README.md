Mutual information with Local Non-uniform Correction(a branch of <a href="https://github.com/gregversteeg/NPEET/">NPEET</a>)


This package contains Python code implementing several entropy estimation functions for both discrete and continuous variables. Information theory provides a model-free way find structure in complex systems, but difficulties in estimating these quantities has traditionally made these techniques infeasible. This package attempts to allay these difficulties by making modern state-of-the-art entropy estimation methods accessible in a single easy-to-use python library. 

The implementation is very simple. It only requires that numpy/scipy be installed. It includes estimators for entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information for both continuous and discrete variables. Additionally it includes a KL Divergence estimator for continuous distributions and mutual information estimator between continuous and discrete variables along with some non-parametric tests for evaluating estimator performance.

The documentation is in npeet_doc.pdf.
It includes description of functions, references, implementation details, and technical discussion about the difficulties in estimating entropies. The <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~gregv/npeet.tgz">code is available here</a>. It requires <a href="http://www.scipy.org">scipy</a> 0.12 or greater. This package is mainly geared to estimating information-theoretic quantities for continuous variables in a non-parametric way. If your primary interest is in discrete entropy estimation, particularly with undersampled data, please see <a href="http://thoth-python.org">this package</a>.</p> 

Example installation and usage:

git clone https://github.com/gregversteeg/NPEET.git

```python
>>> import entropy_estimators as ee
>>> x = [[1.3],[3.7],[5.1],[2.4],[3.4]]
>>> y = [[1.5],[3.32],[5.3],[2.3],[3.3]]
>>> ee.mi(x,y)
Out: 0.168
```
